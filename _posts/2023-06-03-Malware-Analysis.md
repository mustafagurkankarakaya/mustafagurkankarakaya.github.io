When we perform static analysis on the malware, we can observe that it includes an export function named “installer,” which indicates it may be responsible for installing the malicious software.

By searching the hash of the malware in some threat intelligence sources below, we can gain some insights into its behavior.

During the static analysis process, we carefully examine various string values found within the malware. We take note of any strings that appear suspicious or seem to be potentially related to the malicious activity. These identified strings can be valuable and utilized in subsequent stages of our analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the malware’s behavior and functionality.

The presence of strings such as wsock32.dll and send suggests that this malware is likely to use sockets for communication with a Command and Control server. Since the send function is not listed in the Imports and wsock32.dll is not among the imported libraries, it is probable that the malware will dynamically resolve and import this function during its execution.

When the malware is executed, it has been observed to copy itself into the System32 directory under the name spoolvxxx32.dll.

When examining the command line outputs after the malware is executed, it becomes evident that the malicious DLL file is triggered by the “installer” function using the rundll command. This observation indicates that the rundll command is used to initiate the malware’s activities, specifically calling the “installer” function within the DLL file. This step is crucial in understanding how the malware begins its execution process.

# Malware Analysis

When we perform static analysis on the malware, we can observe that it includes an export function named “installer,” which indicates it may be responsible for installing the malicious software.

By searching the hash of the malware in some threat intelligence sources below, we can gain some insights into its behavior.

During the static analysis process, we carefully examine various string values found within the malware. We take note of any strings that appear suspicious or seem to be potentially related to the malicious activity. These identified strings can be valuable and utilized in subsequent stages of our analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the malware’s behavior and functionality.

The presence of strings such as wsock32.dll and send suggests that this malware is likely to use sockets for communication with a Command and Control server. Since the send function is not listed in the Imports and wsock32.dll is not among the imported libraries, it is probable that the malware will dynamically resolve and import this function during its execution.

When the malware is executed, it has been observed to copy itself into the System32 directory under the name spoolvxxx32.dll.

When examining the command line outputs after the malware is executed, it becomes evident that the malicious DLL file is triggered by the “installer” function using the rundll command. This observation indicates that the rundll command is used to initiate the malware’s activities, specifically calling the “installer” function within the DLL file. This step is crucial in understanding how the malware begins its execution process.

With static analysis and the Autoruns tool, we can identify the added or modified registry keys. The registry key shown below has been used to achieve persistence on the systems.

The AppInit_DLLs registry key has been used to achieve persistence on the systems.Proceeding to Basic Dynamic Analysis and running the malware using rundll32.exe, we observe, as anticipated from the string analysis, that the malware gains persistence through the AppInit_DLLs registry key. This method ensures that the DLL is loaded by every process that loads User32.dll, a very common occurrence.

HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Windows\AppInit_DLLs : "spoolvxx32.dll"

This is how the malware establishes persistence, utilizing the AppInit_DLLs registry key. By doing this, the DLL gets loaded by any process that loads User32.dll. Now, let’s examine the DLL Main to understand what occurs when it is loaded by another process.

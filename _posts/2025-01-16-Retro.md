First, we gather information about open ports and services on the target system using nmap.

1.Reconnaissance with Nmap

nmap -A -T4 -Pn 10.10.90.119

![resim]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/Retro2.webp)

smbclient -L 10.10.90.119

In the results of our Nmap scan, we observe that SMB is open on the target system. The next step is to verify whether we can access and view the available shares over SMB without needing to authenticate. This will help us understand if there are any exposed shares that could be accessible without credentials

![resim]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/Retro3.webp)

smbclient //10.10.90.119/Notes -U ""

![resim]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/Retro4.webp)

smbclient //10.10.90.119/Trainees -U ""

Among the listed shares, if there is one that we have access to, letâ€™s examine it further. We should verify the contents and permissions associated with this share to assess if any sensitive information or misconfigurations are exposed
